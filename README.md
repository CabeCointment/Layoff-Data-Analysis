# Layoff-Data-Analysis
This is a project to explore data regarding recent tech layoffs. I hope to gain some insights into the data and gain some more familiarity with plotly.
Using a site called nbviewer will best allow us to view the graphs in the jupyter notebook. Please click the link: https://nbviewer.org/github/CabeCointment/Layoff-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Layoff%20data.ipynb
